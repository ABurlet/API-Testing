# API-Testing

In this assignment, I used JSONPlaceholder in Postman to test three API operations:
- GET
- POST
- DELETE

GET returned a 200 status and list of posts.
POST returned a 201 status and created a fake post with ID 101.
DELETE returned 200 status which confirmed the deletion request.

Challenges:
Overall this assignment was very simple and easy to understand. I didn't experience many challenges apart from figuring out where the appropriate tabs were located. It was straightforward in my opinion.

**Screenshots have been uploaded in individual files in this repo to show GET, POST and DELETE requests.**
